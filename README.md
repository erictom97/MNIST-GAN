# MNIST-GAN
This repository contains an implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using the Keras and TensorFlow frameworks. The GAN is trained on the MNIST dataset to generate synthetic handwritten digits.

# Dataset
The MNIST dataset is a widely used dataset in the field of machine learning. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9) with a resolution of 28x28 pixels.

# Model Architecture
The GAN consists of two components: a generator and a discriminator.

The generator takes a random noise vector as input and generates synthetic images that resemble the handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

The discriminator is a binary classifier that receives an image as input and tries to distinguish between real images from the MNIST dataset and the synthetic images generated by the generator.

The generator and discriminator are trained together in an adversarial manner for 50 epochs. The generator aims to fool the discriminator by generating images that the discriminator cannot distinguish from real images, while the discriminator aims to correctly classify real and synthetic images.

# Results
During training, the GAN learns to generate realistic-looking handwritten digits that resemble those from the MNIST dataset. The quality of the generated images improves as training progresses.
